# resume.json

## Installation

`resume.json` relies on the following dependencies: `ejs`, `relaxed`. Both of these packages can be installed through `npm`. If you 
do not have `npm`, you can download it from [here.](https://nodejs.org/en/) Once you have `npm` installed, run the following commands
from the command line: 

```
npm install relaxedjs -g
npm install ejs -g
```

Once these are installed, you can simply make your changes to either `resume.json` or `resume.ejs` and run `make`. This will output `resume.pdf` to the current directory.
